Its branches gracefully reached towards the sky, a vibrant green canopy swaying gently in the breeze. The villagers admired its beauty and sought solace in its shade.\n","\n","Among the villagers, there lived a young girl named Lily. She had always been captivated by the willow tree's mystic allure. Every evening, she would visit the tree, sitting beneath its comforting branches, sharing her hopes and dreams.\n","\n","One evening, as Lily sat beneath the willow tree, tears streamed down her cheeks. She longed to explore the world beyond the village but feared leaving her beloved tree behind. The willow tree, sensing her distress, whispered in the wind, \"Do not be afraid, dear Lily. Go on your journey, and I promise to be here waiting for your return.\"\n","\n","With newfound courage, Lily set off on her adventure, her heart full of excitement and trepidation. She traveled far and wide, experiencing the wonders of distant lands, meeting new friends, and learning valuable lessons along the way. The world was vast and beautiful, but as time passed, her thoughts often returned to the willow tree.\n","\n","Years went by, and Lily found herself yearning for the familiar embrace of her village. Eager to see her family and friends again, she made her way back, her heart pounding with anticipation.\n","\n","When she arrived, the village had changed. Houses had been replaced, new faces dotted the streets, and even the seasons seemed different. Lily's heart ached with worry as she approached the willow tree, unsure if it would still be standing.\n","\n","To her astonishment, there it stood, taller and more magnificent than ever. Its branches, though slightly weathered, reached out expectantly, as if anticipating her return. Tears welled up in Lily's eyes as she embraced the tree, feeling its comforting presence once again.\n","\n","As she sat beneath the willow tree, she whispered, \"I missed you so much. I never should have left.\" The willow tree rustled its leaves in response, as if reassuring her, \"You did what your heart desired. Now I am here to welcome you back.\"\n","\n","Lily spent the rest of her days in the village, filling her life with the love and warmth she had missed. She shared tales of her adventures beneath the willow tree, and the villagers, young and old, cherished her stories.\n","\n","One day, as the sunset painted the sky with hues of gold and crimson, Lily closed her eyes for the last time. The villagers gathered near the willow tree, holding hands and sharing memories of a life well lived.\n","\n","The willow tree, forever grateful for Lily's devotion, wept silent tears. Its branches, once vibrant, now drooped with sadness. But among its silent tears, there was also the promise of new beginnings, of other souls seeking shelter and solace beneath its branches.\n","\n","In honor of Lily's memory, the villagers planted a new tree nearby—a sapling that would grow into another magnificent willow, carrying the legacy of love and loyalty that Lily and the willow tree shared.\n","\n","And so, the story of the willow tree continued, a story that reminded the villagers of the enduring power of friendship, the beauty of home, and the promise of everlasting connection.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["peom_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=poem_prompt, output_parser=StrOutputParser())"],"metadata":{"id":"Zl4K9h5NSwwk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1699333707024,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":26,"user":{"displayName":"Meera Tresa Sebastian","userId":"06427930610439500734"}}},"id":"Zl4K9h5NSwwk","execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(peom_chain.run(subject))"],"metadata":{"id":"_nTUSzIoZipm","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1699333716156,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":9136,"user":{"displayName":"Meera Tresa Sebastian","userId":"06427930610439500734"}},"outputId":"43341d5c-7eea-4dd8-bc7f-be9254392fd1"},"id":"_nTUSzIoZipm","execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Whispering branches,\n","Graceful dancer in the wind,\n","Ancient tales unfold.\n","\n","Title: Secrets of the Willow\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["What if I use the SimpleSequentialChain, the simplest form of sequential chains, where each step has a singular input/output, and the output of one step is the input to the next."],"metadata":{"id":"tcuuT-taa2MX"},"id":"tcuuT-taa2MX"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["simple_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[joke_chain, story_chain, peom_chain],\n","                                             verbose=True\n","                                            )"],"metadata":{"id":"I4TSGc0gYIlq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1699333716156,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":30,"user":{"displayName":"Meera Tresa Sebastian","userId":"06427930610439500734"}}},"id":"I4TSGc0gYIlq","execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["simple_chain.run(subject)"],"metadata":{"id":"ghEYknlKYd2W","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":576},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1699333865767,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":149639,"user":{"displayName":"Meera Tresa Sebastian","userId":"06427930610439500734"}},"outputId":"b5ed1238-0dfd-43fd-a8e0-63fe4cc19f94"},"id":"ghEYknlKYd2W","execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Entering new SimpleSequentialChain chain...\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mWhy did the willow tree always carry an umbrella?\n","\n","Because it didn't want to be stuck in a \"tree\"-mendous downpour!\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mTitle: The Wise Willow and its Umbrella\n","\n","Once upon a time in a charming little forest, there stood a magnificent willow tree. This particular willow tree was known for its unusual habit of always carrying an umbrella. People often wondered why the willow tree would go through such lengths to carry this accessory wherever it went.\n","\n","When asked about it, the wise old tree would chuckle softly and say, \"Well, my dear friends, I carry this umbrella because I prefer not to be caught in a 'tree'-mendous downpour.\" The forest creatures found this response rather amusing, but they realized there had to be more to the story.\n","\n","Curiosity piqued, a group of woodland animals decided to gather around the willow tree one sunny afternoon. A squirrel, a rabbit, and a songbird perched on the willow's sturdy branches, eagerly waiting to unravel the secret behind the umbrella.\n","\n","The willow tree began to recount the tale of its youth. It all started when the tree was a mere sapling, barely learning to sway with the wind. One stormy night, a ferocious thunderstorm swept across the forest. Heavy raindrops fell in torrents, drenching everything in their path. The frightened sapling thought it would be washed away by the relentless downpour.\n","\n","Suddenly, a passing traveler noticed the plight of the young willow tree. Bearing a kind heart, the traveler extended their umbrella towards the trembling sapling, providing shelter from the storm. In that moment of protection, the willow tree felt safe and secure for the first time.\n","\n","From that day forward, the willow tree vowed never to endure such vulnerability again. It grew stronger, its branches reaching out further and further, spreading its leaves to form a natural canopy. And most importantly, it always carried an umbrella as a symbol of protection and preparedness.\n","\n","The woodland creatures were deeply moved by the willow tree's tale. They understood that even the mightiest creations of nature could experience fear. They admired the willow for learning from its past and taking precautions to ensure its well-being.\n","\n","From then on, the willow tree's umbrella became a source of fascination and admiration for all who passed through the forest. It served as a reminder that it is not shameful to protect oneself from the uncertainties of life. The willow tree's umbrella became a symbol of resilience, wisdom, and the importance of being prepared.\n","\n","As time went on, other trees in the forest began to follow the willow tree's example, carrying their own umbrellas as a sign of strength and readiness. The forest became a vibrant tapestry of colorful umbrellas, each tree standing tall and proud, protected from any \"tree\"-mendous downpour that might come their way.\n","\n","And so, the willow tree's legacy lived on, reminding all who saw it that it's never a weakness to shield oneself when dark clouds loom overhead. It taught the creatures of the forest that even in the face of adversity, there is always a way to stay rooted, stand tall, and weather life's storms.\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3m\"The Wise Willow: A Tale of Strength and Preparedness\"\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'\"The Wise Willow: A Tale of Strength and Preparedness\"'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["There is more coherence between the content generated.

Nation',\n"," 'Language': 'German',\n"," 'Essay': \"Children: The Wealth of a Nation\\n\\nThe future of a nation lies in the hands of its children. They are the foundation upon which progress is built, and their well-being is crucial to the overall prosperity of a country. Children hold immense potential, and nurturing their growth and development is essential for the success of any nation. In this essay, we will explore why children are considered the wealth of a nation and discuss the various factors that contribute to their well-being.\\n\\nOne of the primary reasons children are seen as the wealth of a nation is due to their role as future leaders. They are the ones who will shape and determine the direction of a country in the coming years. Investing in their education and providing them with ample opportunities to learn and grow is paramount. A well-educated and skilled child population will lead to a more prosperous and competitive society in the global arena. This can be achieved through high-quality schools, well-trained teachers, and a curriculum that fosters critical thinking and innovation.\\n\\nAdditionally, children have a significant impact on the economy of a nation. They represent the future workforce and are essential for economic growth. By investing in their health and well-being, a nation ensures a productive workforce in the long run. Adequate nutrition, healthcare, and access to clean water and sanitation are vital for their physical and cognitive development. Proper investment in healthcare and nutrition for children can significantly reduce mortality rates and increase productivity in later years.\\n\\nMoreover, a nation's cultural and social fabric is enriched by its children. They bring diverse perspectives, ideas, and talents that contribute to the overall development of society. Encouraging creativity, curiosity, and artistic expression in children foster a vibrant cultural scene. Their uninhibited thinking and ability to think outside the box can offer innovative solutions to various social, economic, and environmental challenges faced by a nation. By nurturing their talents and providing a nurturing environment, a nation can harness their potential to create a better future for all.\\n\\nFurthermore, prioritizing children's rights and protection is a reflection of a nation's commitment to human rights and social justice. Ensuring the safety and well-being of children is not only a moral obligation but also a legal requirement. Protecting children from exploitation, abuse, and neglect is essential to building a just and equitable society. Quality child protection systems, including robust child welfare services, access to justice, and child-friendly policies, are critical for safeguarding their rights.\\n\\nLastly, children represent the continuation of a nation's legacy. They learn from the experiences and wisdom of previous generations and carry forward their culture, traditions, and values. By preserving and passing on knowledge, a nation ensures its sustainability and long-term survival. Celebrating and embracing diversity, including ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity, fosters social cohesion and harmony. Children are the torchbearers who carry this legacy forward, weaving together the tapestry of a nation's history and identity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, children are the wealth of a nation due to their potential as future leaders, their impact on the economy, their contribution to the cultural and social fabric, the reflection of a nation's commitment to human rights, and their role in preserving a nation's legacy. A nation that recognizes the importance of investing in its children, protecting their rights, and nurturing their growth is paving the way for a brighter and more prosperous future. It is imperative that governments and societies alike prioritize the well-being of children to unlock their full potential and secure the wealth of the nation.\",\n"," 'Summary': \"Children are considered the wealth of a nation because they are future leaders who shape the country's direction. Investing in their education and providing opportunities for growth leads to a prosperous society. They also impact the economy as the workforce, so investing in their health and well-being ensures productivity. Children enrich a nation's cultural and social fabric, contributing diverse perspectives and talents. Prioritizing their rights and protection reflects a commitment to human rights and social justice. Lastly, they carry forward a nation's legacy and preserve its culture, traditions, and values. Overall, investing in children secures a brighter future.\",\n"," 'Translated_Summary': 'Kinder gelten als Reichtum einer Nation, da sie zukünftige Führungskräfte sind, die die Richtung des Landes prägen. Eine Investition in ihre Bildung und die Bereitstellung von Wachstumsmöglichkeiten führt zu einer wohlhabenden Gesellschaft. Sie beeinflussen auch die Wirtschaft als Arbeitskraft, daher gewährleistet eine Investition in ihre Gesundheit und ihr Wohlergehen Produktivität. Kinder bereichern das kulturelle und soziale Gefüge einer Nation und tragen diverse Perspektiven und Talente bei. Die Priorisierung ihrer Rechte und ihr Schutz spiegelt ein Engagement für Menschenrechte und soziale Gerechtigkeit wider.
