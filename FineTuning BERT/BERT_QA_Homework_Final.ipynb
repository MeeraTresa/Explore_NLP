Formally established in 1475, although it is much older, it is one of the oldest libraries in the world and contains one of the most significant collections of historical texts. It has 75,000 codices from throughout history, as well as 1.1 million printed books, which include some 8,500 incunabula. \\n\\nThe Vatican Library is a research library for history, law, philosophy, science and theology.

They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\"},\n","  {'qas': [{'question': \"Which film featured Destiny's Child's first major single?\",\n","     'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90a9',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"For which song, did Destiny's Child take home the grammy award for best R&B performance?\",\n","     'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ab',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '\"Say My Name\"', 'answer_start': 848}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Who did Beyonce record with for the movie \"The Best Man?\"',\n","     'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ac',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"Beyonce's group changed their name to Destiny's Child in what year?\",\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9677',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '1996', 'answer_start': 51}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"The name Destiny's Child was based on a quote in which book of the Bible?\",\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9678',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah', 'answer_start': 85}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Debut song, \"Killing Time\" was featured on what movie\\'s sound track?',\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9679',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'What song won Best R&B Performance in the 43 Annual Grammy Awards?',\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967a',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Say My Name', 'answer_start': 849}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'What singer did Beyonce record a song with for the movie, \\'\\'The Best Man\"?',\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967b',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"Where did Destiny's Child get their name from?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830f9',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah.', 'answer_start': 85}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"Destiny's Child song, Killing Time, was included in which film's soundtrack?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fa',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black.', 'answer_start': 215}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"What was Destiny's Child's first major song hit?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fb',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'No, No, No', 'answer_start': 330}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"When did Destiny's Child release their second album?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fc',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '1999', 'answer_start': 688}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Who did Beyoncé sing a duet with for \"The Best Man\" film?',\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fd',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}],\n","     'is_impossible': False}],\n","   'context': 'The group changed their name to Destiny\\'s Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.

The album formally introduces Beyoncé\\'s alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \"Crazy in Love\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US.

Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"\\'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s.

Beyoncé said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was \"finding the best qualities in every human being.\" With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls.
