And like just about everyone else, they were shaken out of their sleep. \\n\\n\"It was so frightening,\" Sam wrote. \"The shaking was so huge that I will never go on a ride again.\" Cecilia and Sam wrote about their earthquake experiences. Their reports were later posted on the website. \\n\\nCecilia, Sam and their parents were staying in an apartment on the 15th floor of a building. They were lucky. Their building stayed standing, because it was built to withstand earthquakes. \\n\\nNot everyone was as lucky as the Wallace family. More than 800 people died. Many older buildings fell down during the earthquake. \\n\\nThe damage in Santiago wasn\\'t as bad as in other parts of Chile. So the supermarkets were open for business on the morning of the quake. But it wasn\\'t business as usual. \"The supermarkets have been crazy with people rushing to buy their food for the next while,\" Sam wrote. \\n\\nNot everyone was able to get money to buy food that morning. So Cecilia and Sam made food bags to _ to people who were begging outside the supermarket. \"We gave some to a kid of my age. I made sure he got cookies and bread.\" Sam and Cecilia\\'s mother wrote that the kids also collected money for the Red Cross. \\n\\nIt\\'s certainly an experience Cecilia, Sam and their parents will never forget. Thankfully, they lived to tell their stories.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["question"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"id":"k1yXYfad9Rh7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698944069810,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":386,"user":{"displayName":"Meera Tresa Sebastian","userId":"06427930610439500734"}},"outputId":"be3315b6-24a9-4e0a-bd27-161ae65194e9"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'on what date?'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# tokeninzing the question and answer pair\n","input_ids = tokenizer.encode(question, text)\n","print(\"The input has a total of {} tokens.\".format(len(input_ids)))"],"metadata":{"id":"NuXoPLD5kgZP","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698944076462,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":262,"user":{"displayName":"Meera Tresa Sebastian","userId":"06427930610439500734"}},"outputId":"1ff56fe4-0a1a-4e5d-8f66-a9c3430c546e"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The input has a total of 352 tokens.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We inspect the resulting tokens and observe that each word is assigned a unique token, and that some rare words are getting split into multiple tokens.

After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\"},\n","  {'qas': [{'question': \"Which film featured Destiny's Child's first major single?\",\n","     'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90a9',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"For which song, did Destiny's Child take home the grammy award for best R&B performance?\",\n","     'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ab',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '\"Say My Name\"', 'answer_start': 848}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Who did Beyonce record with for the movie \"The Best Man?\"',\n","     'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ac',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"Beyonce's group changed their name to Destiny's Child in what year?\",\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9677',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '1996', 'answer_start': 51}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"The name Destiny's Child was based on a quote in which book of the Bible?\",\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9678',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah', 'answer_start': 85}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Debut song, \"Killing Time\" was featured on what movie\\'s sound track?',\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9679',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'What song won Best R&B Performance in the 43 Annual Grammy Awards?',\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967a',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Say My Name', 'answer_start': 849}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'What singer did Beyonce record a song with for the movie, \\'\\'The Best Man\"?',\n","     'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967b',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"Where did Destiny's Child get their name from?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830f9',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah.', 'answer_start': 85}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"Destiny's Child song, Killing Time, was included in which film's soundtrack?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fa',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black.', 'answer_start': 215}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"What was Destiny's Child's first major song hit?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fb',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'No, No, No', 'answer_start': 330}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': \"When did Destiny's Child release their second album?\",\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fc',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '1999', 'answer_start': 688}],\n","     'is_impossible': False},\n","    {'question': 'Who did Beyoncé sing a duet with for \"The Best Man\" film?',\n","     'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fd',\n","     'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}],\n","     'is_impossible': False}],\n","   'context': 'The group changed their name to Destiny\\'s Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.

She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan\\'s Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyoncé\\'s alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \"Crazy in Love\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and the top-five songs \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"\\'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \"Sweet Dreams\", and singles \"Diva\", \"Ego\", \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" and \"Video Phone\". The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift\\'s \"You Belong with Me\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyoncé improvising a re-presentation of Swift\\'s award during her own acceptance speech. In March 2009, Beyoncé embarked on the I Am...

This made her the first woman in the chart\\'s history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. Beyoncé received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days; The New York Times noted the album\\'s unconventional, unexpected release as significant. Musically an electro-R&B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as \"bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood\". The single \"Drunk in Love\", featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In April 2014, after much speculation in the weeks before, Beyoncé and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour. It served as the couple\\'s first co-headlining stadium tour together. On August 24, 2014, she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Knowles also took home three competitive awards: Best Video with a Social Message and Best Cinematography for \"Pretty Hurts\", as well as best collaboration for \"Drunk in Love\". In November, Forbes reported that Beyoncé was the top-earning woman in music for the second year in a row—earning $115 million in the year, more than double her earnings in 2013.

In 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music. A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. In advance of the concert, she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013, where she, along with Cameron Diaz, John Legend and Kylie Minogue, described inspiration from their mothers, while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women, leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers\\' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert. Beyoncé said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was \"finding the best qualities in every human being.\" With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls. Beyoncé is also taking part in \"Miss a Meal\", a food-donation campaign, and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and
