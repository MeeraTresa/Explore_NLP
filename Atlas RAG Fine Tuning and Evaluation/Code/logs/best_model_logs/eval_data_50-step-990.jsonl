Consequently, this reduction in variance leads to a smaller risk of the model fitting the training data noise and, thus, generalizes better to new, unseen data.

One of the primary issues arises when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is not linear, as linear regression assumes a linear relationship. When the data exhibits non-linearity, the model may fail to capture the underlying patterns, leading to poor predictions. Another problem is the correlation of error terms, which violates the assumption of independence of errors and can result in biased parameter estimates. Non-constant variance of error terms, also known as heteroscedasticity, is another issue that can lead to inefficient estimates and affect the accuracy of predictions. Outliers and high-leverage points can have a disproportionate impact on the regression line, potentially skewing the results. Finally, collinearity, the presence of highly correlated independent variables, can make it difficult to ascertain the effect of each variable on the dependent variable, leading to unstable parameter estimates.

They involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training set and retting a model of interest on each sample in order to obtain additional information about the fitted model. For example, in order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to obtain information that would not be available from fitting the model only once using the original training sample. Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive, because they involve fitting the same statistical method multiple times using different subsets of the training data. However, due to recent advances in computing power, the computational requirements of resampling methods generally are not prohibitive. In this chapter, we discuss two of the most commonly used resampling methods, cross-validation and the bootstrap. Both methods are important tools in the practical application of many statistical learning procedures. For example, cross-validation can be used to estimate the test error associated with a given statistical learning method in order to evaluate its performance, or to select the appropriate level of flexibility. The process of evaluating a model s performance is known as model assessment, whereas the process of selecting the proper level of flexibility or a model is known as model selection.

For example, in order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to obtain information that would not be available from fitting the model only once using the original training sample. Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive, because they involve fitting the same statistical method multiple times using different subsets of the training data. However, due to recent advances in computing power, the computational requirements of resampling methods generally are not prohibitive. In this chapter, we discuss two of the most commonly used resampling methods, cross-validation and the bootstrap. Both methods are important tools in the practical application of many statistical learning procedures. For example, cross-validation can be used to estimate the test error associated with a given statistical learning method in order to evaluate its performance, or to select the appropriate level of flexibility. The process of evaluating a model s performance is known as model assessment, whereas the process of selecting the proper level of flexibility or a model is known as model selection.
